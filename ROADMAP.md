# Gren Roadmap

Here is a plan for what future releases of Gren will focus on, on the road to 1.0.

This is to be considered a living document. Releases may arrive late due to real-life changes of the contributors involved. We may also learn new things along the way which change the things we wish to focus on.

Also, keep in mind that this only focuses on the big picture. Major features like parametric modules and Web Assembly are likely to cause an avalanche of other changes as well.

## Releases

- June 2025 - Rewrite dependency management in Gren
- December 2025 - Rewrite parser in Gren. Parametric modules. Operators as syntax sugar.
